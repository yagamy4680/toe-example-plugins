#!/usr/bin/env lsc -cj
#

# Known issue:
#   when executing the `package.ls` directly, there is always error
#   "/usr/bin/env: lsc -cj: No such file or directory", that is because `env`
#   doesn't allow space.
#
#   More details are discussed on StackOverflow:
#     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3306518/cannot-pass-an-argument-to-python-with-usr-bin-env-python
#
#   The alternative solution is to add `envns` script to /usr/bin directory
#   to solve the _no space_ issue.
#
#   Or, you can simply type `lsc -cj package.ls` to generate `package.json`
#   quickly.
